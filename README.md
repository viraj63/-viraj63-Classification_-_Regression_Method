## Classification_-_Regression_Method
### Learning Classification models without using In-built models

So this assignment is focused on learning how to build classification and regression models from scratch. In the first part of this assignment,
I will implement the logistic regression and test it on a penguin data set. In the second part, I will recommend the linear regression using OLS which is ordinary least square and in the third part 
I will extend it to the ridge regression. And I will also add two components that is the gradient descent and elastic net regularization from scratch. So the goal of this assignment is to practice implementing 
logistic classification and understanding the Practical implementation of different regression models. So for this particular assignment, I won't be using any psychic learns or any other inbuilt libraries that would directly help me implement the ML methods.
